# Binary Trees
I have implemented the following Data Strucures - <br></br>
a.  BST <br></br>
b.  AVL Trees <br></br>
c.  Treaps <br></br>
d.  SkipList <br></br>

Each DS has its own node structure and a controller class which has a main function.
To see the execution of any DS, run its corresponding controller class.
